## 1.1 Social Engineering

**Ways to get manipulated**

- Phishing: Fake/ scam emails
  - Spear phishing: Tailored to catch a specific person. "Hello Robert from Echo Co. 148!"
  - Whaling: Spear phishing a high-ranking authorized user "Dear Joe Biden...send nuke codes"
  - 
- Smishing: Fake/ scam texts. Named derived from SMS
- Vishing: Fake/ scam calls. "Here to reach you about you car's extended warranty"
- Spam: Annoying, unsolicited email
- SPIM: Annoying, unsolicited text

**Tactics**

- Shoulder surfing: Watching or peaking a person's monitor/ screen for sensitive information
- Dumpster diving: Literally going through their trash for information
- Pharming: Using DNS to route a domain to a phishing site
- Tailgating: Following someone with authority to locations that are unauthorized for you. Like holding a door open after someone else scans their badge to enter.
- Eliciting Information: Use of small talk to obtain sensitive information "Yeah, the commander and I are going to be attending the graduation ceremony for the upcoming class" (Perfect time for a hacker to walk into their office and scrape some data off his computer. Thanks for the info sucka!!!!)
- Prepending: Modifying a file to look like another file. For example, FamilyPhoto.jpg vs FamilyPhoto.exe (PSA. Don't run .exe files you don't know)
- Identity fraud: Its not a joke Jim
- Invoice scams: Invoices or bills from scammers pretending to be a good/ service that the <u>victim trusts.</u>
- Credential Harvesting: Stealing credentials. (PSA. Don't lose your CAC. Don't leave a sticky note with your passwords next to your computer)
- Reconnaissance: Gaining information of victim or target. Maybe through OSINT (covered later)? Maybe using one of the above methods.
- Hoax: Non-threatning attack that appears threatning
- Impersonation: Pretending to be someone else ("Catch me if you can" the 2002 movie)
- Watering Hole Attack: Legitimate website that target victim visits often which is infected with malware by hacker
- Typosquatting/ URL Hijacking: Making a URL similar to a legitimate website to trick a victim into a fake website. For example, Amazon.com vs Amaz0n.com
- Pre-texting: Formulating a fake scenario to trick a target into thinking a request is legitimate, or gain sympathy to bend rules. [Example](https://youtu.be/lc7scxvKQOo?si=9eP6g3n60LvsQP1m&t=47)

Influence Campaigns use hybrid warefare, which is the use of politics, culture, social media, cyberspace, etc. in war

**Principles of effective social engineering**

- Authority: Appears to be coming from superordinate or legitimate business, coworker, etc with authorization.
- Intimidation: Invokes a fear of punishment or responsibility of a major loss
- Consensus/ social proof: Comforts to a popular verdict (sheeple. beheheheheh)
- Scarcity: Invokes a fear of missing out on a rewarding opportunity
- Urgency: Pressures the victim into taking action due to a closing time frame
- Familiarity/ Liking: Friendship or bond building using a victims sense of humor, hobbies, tastes, etc.
